## 🚀 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY

### Can This Be Built?

**YES** - Here's why:

1. **FastAPI** ✅ - Handles async AI calls, WebSockets, high concurrency
2. **React + Three.js** ✅ - Proven 3D web gaming stack
3. **MongoDB** ✅ - Flexible schema for complex player data
4. **Emergent LLM** ✅ - GPT-4o can handle complex reasoning
5. **WebSockets** ✅ - Real-time multiplayer is standard

### Estimated Development Timeline

**MVP (Core Features)**: 14-16 weeks  
**Full Game**: 24-28 weeks  
**Live Service**: Ongoing

### Estimated Costs

**LLM API Costs** (Emergent Key):  
- Per action evaluation: $0.01-0.03
- With caching: $0.005-0.01
- 100 active players: $10-30/day
- 1000 active players: $100-300/day

**Optimization**: Cache common scenarios, only call AI for complex situations
